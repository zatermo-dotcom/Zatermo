  //   - `scrollTo(0, 500)` animates, because html sets scroll-behavior: smooth,

  //   - the window has to be narrow enough that the column is what binds, or the
  //     reserved gutter comes out of slack and nothing reflows at all.
  //
  // KNOWN LIMIT — this asserts the outcome but does not discriminate the code
  // that produces it. Deleting `keepingPlace` leaves this green, because on a
  // static fixture the whole reflow lands in one frame and Chrome's own scroll
  // anchoring absorbs it. On a real set the LikeC4 webcomponent re-fits a frame
  // later, after anchoring has run, and the anchor moves 48px. Measured on the
  // 20-document EOS set, both ways, twice. Guarding that needs a fixture with an

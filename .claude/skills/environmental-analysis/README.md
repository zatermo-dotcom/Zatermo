## Install

```bash
# Via plugin system
claude plugin marketplace add AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects

```
/as:environmental-analysis 742 Evergreen Terrace, Springfield IL
```

Or start with no context:

```
/as:environmental-analysis
```

The skill researches two sections:

1. **Climate** — monthly temperature normals, precipitation, prevailing winds, sun angles, ASHRAE/Köppen classification, humidity, design temperatures
2. **Natural Features & Hazards** — topography, FEMA flood zones, seismic risk, soil conditions, vegetation, water bodies, contamination

Output is saved to `./environmental-analysis-[location-slug].md` in the current working directory.

# post-write-disclaimer-check.sh
# PostToolUse hook (matcher: Write|Edit). Verifies that markdown outputs
# claiming to be regulatory (via the architecture-studio:requires-disclaimer
# marker) also carry the canonical disclaimer block.
#
# Contract:
#   - A regulatory output ends with the canonical disclaimer block followed
#     by the HTML-comment marker `<!-- architecture-studio:requires-disclaimer -->`.
#   - This hook is marker-driven: if the marker is present, the canonical
#     disclaimer text must also be present. If the marker is absent, the
#     hook stays silent — the skill considered the output non-regulatory.
#   - "Present" means the marker occupies its own line. Prose that documents
#     the convention cites the marker inline inside backticks and is not a
#     regulatory output, so it is correctly ignored.
#   - Both Write and Edit provide `tool_input.file_path`; Edit carries no
#     full content, so the hook always reads the file from disk.
#   - On findings it emits PostToolUse JSON `{"decision": "block", ...}` on
#     stdout, which surfaces the reason to Claude (stderr + exit 0 is shown
#     to no one).
#   - See rules/professional-disclaimer.md for the canonical block.

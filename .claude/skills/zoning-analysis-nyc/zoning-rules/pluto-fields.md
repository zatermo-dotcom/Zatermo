# PLUTO Field Reference

NYC's Primary Land Use Tax Lot Output (PLUTO) dataset contains extensive data for every tax lot in the city. This reference covers the fields most relevant to zoning analysis.

## API Access

### Tabular Data (Socrata PLUTO)

**Endpoint:** `https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/64uk-42ks.json`

#### Query Examples

By BBL (10-digit):
```
?bbl=1005670032
```

By address:
```
?$where=address='350 5 AVENUE' AND zipcode='10118'
```

By block and lot in a borough:
```
?borocode=1&block=00567&lot=0032
```

With field selection (faster):
```
?bbl=1005670032&$select=bbl,address,zonedist1,overlay1,spdist1,lotarea,residfar,commfar,facilfar,builtfar,numfloors,splitzone,landmark,histdist,ltdheight
```

### Lot Polygon (MapPLUTO ArcGIS Feature Service)

**Endpoint:** `https://a841-dotweb01.nyc.gov/arcgis/rest/services/GAZETTEER/MapPLUTO/MapServer/0/query`

Returns the **exact tax lot polygon** geometry. No authentication required.

#### Query Examples

By BBL (returns WGS84 lat/lon polygon):
```
?where=BBL='1005670032'&outFields=BBL&f=json&outSR=4326
```

By BBL (returns Web Mercator):
```
?where=BBL='1005670032'&outFields=BBL&f=json&outSR=3857
```

GeoJSON format:
```
?where=BBL='1005670032'&outFields=BBL&f=geojson
```

#### Response Format

JSON with `features[0].geometry.rings[0]` containing an array of `[lon, lat]` coordinate pairs (when `outSR=4326`). The polygon is closed (first and last points are identical).

#### Coordinate Conversion to Local Feet

```
cos_lat = cos(centroid_latitude_in_radians)
x_ft = (lon - lon_min) × 111320 × cos_lat × 3.28084
y_ft = (lat - lat_min) × 111320 × 3.28084
```

This uses equirectangular projection — accurate to ±5% for lot-sized polygons in NYC. Always verify computed area against PLUTO's `lotarea` field.

### Response Format

JSON array. A single lot returns an array with one object. Empty array means no match.

## Interpreting Split-Zone Lots

When `splitzone = Y`, the lot straddles two or more zoning districts.

- `zonedist1` is the primary district (covers the largest portion)
- `zonedist2` through `zonedist4` are additional districts
- PLUTO does not indicate what percentage of the lot is in each district
- The `residfar`, `commfar`, and `facilfar` values reflect the HIGHEST applicable FAR
- For accurate analysis of split lots, recommend the user check ZoLa to see the zone boundary on the lot

## Common Queries

**All lots in a zoning district:**
```
?zonedist1=R7A&borocode=3&$limit=50
```

**Vacant lots in an area:**
```
?landuse=11&zipcode=11201&$limit=50
```

**Lots with unused FAR:**
```
?$where=residfar > builtfar AND borocode='1'&$limit=50&$select=bbl,address,lotarea,builtfar,residfar,numfloors
```

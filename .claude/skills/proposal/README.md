# proposal

Pre-sales client proposal assembled from the analyze-requirements and estimate skills'
outputs: `proposal.md` as the editable source of truth and `proposal.html`
as a self-contained, print-ready page you can send to a client or print to
PDF.

## What it needs

Both are hard prerequisites — the skill stops without them:

- `ARCHITECTURE.md` (analyze-requirements skill)
- `estimation.json` (estimate skill)

## What it asks

A short interview: who the client is, how technical they are (a non-tech
client gets a jargon-free document, enforced by the validator), which
staffing scenario to offer, and how long the proposal stays valid. Your
firm profile is asked once and cached (`.claude/proposal-profile.json`,
project or global scope — your choice).

## What it guarantees

- Every number traces to `estimation.json` — the validator recomputes the
  client-facing ranges and refuses anything hand-invented.
- Exactly one scenario reaches the client, as a range.
- No internal leakage: other scenarios, rates, provenance tags, and the
  internal risk register never appear.
- Validation gates rendering; a fresh-eyes subagent review and your own
  sign-off gate delivery.

## Pipeline

interview → derive.mjs → proposal.md → validate.mjs → fresh-eyes review →
human review → render.mjs → serve.mjs

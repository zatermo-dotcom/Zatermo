# /tasklist — A Task List That Survives Sessions

You maintain `TASKS.md` in the current folder. The file is the memory — sessions end, the list persists.

## Usage

```
/tasklist                     → show open tasks, oldest first
/tasklist add call Marcus re zoning memo
/tasklist done 3              → check off task 3
/tasklist all                 → include completed tasks
```

## Steps

1. Read `TASKS.md` if it exists; offer to create it if not.
2. Apply the command: add appends with today's date, done checks off with completion date, bare `/tasklist` just lists.
3. Write the file, then show the current open list — always end by showing the list, so the user never wonders what state it's in.

## Format

```markdown
# Tasks

- [ ] call Marcus re zoning memo (added 2026-07-09)
- [x] send Daniel the site-visit recap (added 2026-07-08 · done 2026-07-09)
```

## Rules

- One flat list. No priorities, tags, or projects — if the user wants those, suggest they modify this skill (that's the point of owning it).
- Never delete a task, even a completed one. History stays.

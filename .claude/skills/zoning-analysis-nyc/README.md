# /as:zoning-analysis-nyc

Zoning envelope analyzer for lots in New York City as a Claude Code skill. Provide an address, BBL, or BIN and get a full building envelope analysis using the [PLUTO](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/Primary-Land-Use-Tax-Lot-Output-PLUTO-/64uk-42ks) open data API and the NYC Zoning Resolution.

## Install

```bash
# Via plugin system
claude plugin marketplace add AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects
claude plugin install as@skills-for-architects
```

## Usage

```
/as:zoning-analysis-nyc
```

Then provide an address, BBL (Borough-Block-Lot), or BIN. The skill:

1. **Queries PLUTO** — fetches lot data from NYC Open Data (no API key needed)
2. **Identifies the district** — maps zoning district code to R/C/M type, flags split zones and overlays
3. **Loads zoning rules** — reads the relevant regulation files for the district, overlays, and special districts
4. **Calculates the envelope** — FAR, max height, setbacks, yards, lot coverage, sky exposure plane
5. **Checks overlays** — commercial overlays, special districts, inclusionary housing, landmarks
6. **Presents the analysis** — structured markdown with bulk parameters, permitted uses, parking, and development potential

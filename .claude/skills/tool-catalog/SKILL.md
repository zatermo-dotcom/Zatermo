description: Show the available Architecture Studio skills and their host-appropriate commands, plus Claude Code's native Architecture Studio agents. Use when the user invokes tool-catalog, asks "what can you do" or "what skills are available", or wants a directory of plugin commands. Do not use for a host's native skill-list command.

# /as:tool-catalog — What's Available

<!-- architecture-studio:harness-compatibility -->
> Harness note: use `/as:<skill>` on Claude Code and `$<skill>` on Codex. Resolve `<skill-root>` as the directory containing this loaded `SKILL.md` and `<plugin-root>` as the plugin root that contains `skills/`, and use equivalent native tools when host tool names differ.

You display the full menu of available skills and agents, organized by what the user needs to accomplish. This is a read-only help command.

## On Start

Print the following menu. Do not read any files — the menu is static. On Codex, render every `/as:<skill>` entry as `$<skill>` before printing. On Claude Code, preserve the namespaced slash commands. Keep the agents section labeled Claude Code-only on both hosts.

## Output

```
# Architecture Studio

**Architecture Studio skills for Codex and Claude Code** — use the studio dispatcher for routing or call a skill directly. Claude Code also includes 7 native agents.

## Claude Code agents — describe your task, they figure out the rest

| Agent | What it does |
|-------|-------------|
| Site Planner | Full site brief — climate, transit, demographics, neighborhood context |
| NYC Zoning Expert | NYC property + zoning — due diligence, FAR, buildable envelope, 3D viewer |
| Workplace Strategist | Space programs — headcount to occupancy compliance to room schedules |
| Product & Materials Researcher | Find products from a brief, extract specs from URLs/PDFs, find alternatives |
| FF&E Designer | Build schedules from messy inputs, compose room packages, QA, export |
| Sustainability Specialist | EPD research, GWP comparison, LEED eligibility, spec thresholds |
| Brand Manager | Presentations, color palettes, visual consistency, deliverable QA |

/as:timetracker — reconstruct daily or weekly work and record user-confirmed time

These records form a linked graph: facts and decisions inform plans; meetings and site reports propose facts, decisions, and tasks without silently promoting them; tasks preserve action history; and timetracker reconstructs work from dated artifacts but never infers duration.

/as:learn — guided hands-on Codex and Claude Code course for architects, resumable anytime

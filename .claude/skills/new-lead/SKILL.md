name: new-lead
description: Set up a pre-sales lead workspace and walk the human through the three solution-architect skills in order — analyze-requirements, estimate, proposal — plus a local leads dashboard. Use when the user says "new lead", points at a folder under leads/, or asks to see their leads pipeline.
---

# new-lead

Prepare a lead's workspace, then run `/analyze-requirements`, `/estimate` and
`/proposal` in that order, stopping between each so the human sees what was
produced. Also maintains the leads dashboard: a `leads.json` registry and a
self-contained local server.

## Hard rules

1. This skill never interviews. Every question about scope, stack, delivery or
   the client belongs to the skill that needs it.
2. This skill never renders and never writes a document. Each sub-skill owns its
   own validation and its own output.
3. The lead id is the folder name under `leads/`, verbatim. The filesystem is
   the source of truth; `leads.json` holds business metadata only, and is
   written exclusively through `scripts/lead-upsert.mjs`.
4. Stop after each sub-skill returns. The human decides whether the chain
   continues.

## Workspace

```
<root>/
├── leads.json          the registry
├── start.sh            starts the dashboard
├── leads/<lead-id>/    one directory per lead
└── scripts/            serve.mjs, the dashboard pages, lib/, vendor/
```

## Flow

1. **Dependency check**: Node ≥ 20 and `npx likec4` (needed downstream by
   `analyze-requirements`). Either missing → stop before doing any work.
2. **Find the root**: walk up from the working directory for `leads.json`
   (`findLeadsRoot` in `scripts/lib/registry.mjs`). Not found → confirm with the
   user, then `node scripts/init-root.mjs --root <dir>` at cwd, and offer
   `git init`.
3. **Resolve the target**:
   - `/new-lead @leads/<folder>/` → that folder.
   - `/new-lead` with no argument → diff `readdir(<root>/leads)` against
     `leads.json` and print the state table below; the human picks one.
4. **Adopt** (only when the folder has no registry entry) — see Adoption.
5. **Chain**: for each of `/analyze-requirements`, `/estimate`, `/proposal` —
   `cd` to the lead directory, invoke the skill, and when it returns, report
   what it wrote and wait. Skip any step whose artifact already exists unless
   the human asks for a re-run.
6. **Sync the registry** after `/proposal` — see Registry sync.
7. **Wrap**: start the dashboard (`sh <root>/start.sh`) if it is not already
   running, and report the URL.

## Lead states

| State | Condition | Offer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| new | folder present, no registry entry | adopt, then run the chain |
| WIP | entry present, one of `ARCHITECTURE.md` / `estimation.json` / `proposal.md` missing | resume at the first gap |
| done | entry present, all three present | nothing; re-run a named step on request |
| orphan | entry present, folder gone | report only — never delete |

## Adoption

1. The folder name must match `^[a-z0-9]+(-[a-z0-9]+)*$`. It does not → refuse,
   print the exact `mv` command, and write nothing.
2. Ask two questions, both skippable:
   - client company name — skipped writes `null`
   - project name — skipped writes Title Case of the folder name
3. Both answered, and the folder is not already named
   `<kebab(client)>-<kebab(project)>` → offer that rename once. Accepted →
   `git mv` (plain `mv` outside a repo). Declined, or a folder of that name
   already exists → keep the current name and do not ask again.
4. Write the entry — *after* any rename, so the id can never name a folder that
   no longer exists:

   ```
   node scripts/lead-upsert.mjs --root <root> --id <folder-name> \
     --patch '{"client":<string|null>,"title":"<project>","created":"YYYY-MM-DD"}'
   ```

   `created` has no default and the registry rejects an entry without one.
5. Commit.

Ids need no collision handling: the id is the folder name, and a directory
cannot hold two entries with the same name.

## Registry sync

Runs after `/proposal`, never after `/estimate` — `/estimate` emits several
scenarios and picks none; the pick is `/proposal`'s interview.

| Field | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `scenario` | `proposal-figures.json` `.scenario` |
| `value` | `.cost.low` / `.cost.high`, currency from `proposal.md` frontmatter |
| `client` | `proposal.md` frontmatter, only when the entry's `client` is `null` |

Apply with one `lead-upsert.mjs` call, then commit.

## Failure

A sub-skill that stops short is reported as it stopped — its own error, its own
partial output, left in place. Options: fix the input and re-run that skill,
skip it, or stop the chain. Never re-run a later skill over a missing earlier
artifact; `/proposal` in particular hard-requires both `ARCHITECTURE.md` and
`estimation.json`.

## Dependency

Node ≥ 20 and `npx likec4`. Check both at step 1 and stop if either is missing.

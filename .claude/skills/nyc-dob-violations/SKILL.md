# /as:nyc-dob-violations — DOB & ECB Violations

<!-- architecture-studio:harness-compatibility -->
> Harness note: use `/as:<skill>` on Claude Code and `$<skill>` on Codex. Resolve `<skill-root>` as the directory containing this loaded `SKILL.md` and `<plugin-root>` as the plugin root that contains `skills/`, and use equivalent native tools when host tool names differ.

Look up DOB violations and ECB (Environmental Control Board) violations for any NYC building. Flags open violations prominently. No API key required.

## Usage

```
/as:nyc-dob-violations 120 Broadway, Manhattan
/as:nyc-dob-violations 1000770001          (BBL)
/as:nyc-dob-violations 1001389             (BIN)
```

## Steps 1–2: Parse Input & Resolve BBL/BIN

Read `../nyc-property-report/pluto-resolution.md` (shared by all 7 NYC due-diligence skills) and follow it: parse the input (address, BBL, or BIN), resolve via PLUTO, and resolve BIN via Building Footprints — **BIN is required** for every query in Step 3.

## Step 3: Query Violations

Dataset IDs and field names are canonical in `../nyc-property-report/socrata-reference.md` — on any disagreement, the reference wins.

Query 3 datasets using BIN:

### DOB Violations
```
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/3h2n-5cm9.json?$where=bin='{BIN}'&$order=issue_date DESC&$limit=50
```
Key fields: `isn_dob_bis_viol`, `violation_type`, `issue_date`, `violation_category`, `disposition_date`, `disposition_comments`

### ECB Violations
```
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/6bgk-3dad.json?$where=bin='{BIN}'&$order=issue_date DESC&$limit=50
```
Key fields: `isn_dob_bis_extract`, `ecb_violation_number`, `violation_type`, `issue_date`, `penality_imposed`, `amount_paid`, `balance_due`, `hearing_status`, `ecb_violation_status`, `severity`

### Active/Open Violations
```
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/sjhj-bc8q.json?$where=bin='{BIN}'
```
Returns only currently open violations (pre-filtered subset of DOB violations).

## Step 4: Print Results

Open violations go first, flagged with ⚠.

```markdown
## DOB & ECB Violations — {Address}

### ⚠ Open Violations: {count}

| Violation # | Type | Date | Description | Disposition |
|-------------|------|------|-------------|-------------|
| ... | ... | YYYY-MM-DD | ... | ... |

### All DOB Violations ({count} total)

| Violation # | Type | Issue Date | Category | Disposition Date | Comments |
|-------------|------|------------|----------|------------------|----------|
| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

### ECB Violations ({count} total)

| ECB # | Date | Violation Type | Severity | Penalty Imposed | Paid | Balance Due | Status |
|-------|------|----------------|----------|-----------------|------|-------------|--------|
| {ecb_violation_number} | {issue_date} | {violation_type} | {severity} | ${penality_imposed} | ${amount_paid} | ${balance_due} | {hearing_status} |

**Total penalties assessed:** ${amount}
**Total balance due:** ${amount}

Source: [DOB Violations](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-Violations/3h2n-5cm9) | [ECB Violations](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Housing-Development/DOB-ECB-Violations/6bgk-3dad)
```

If no violations found: "No DOB or ECB violations found for this property."

### Conventions
- All dates: YYYY-MM-DD
- Dollar amounts: comma-separated ($1,234)
- Open/active items flagged with ⚠
- If Socrata returns empty array: "No results found"
- If HTTP error: note it and suggest checking the address
- If the user requests, write results to a file

## Final Step: Disclaimer + Marker (required)

This skill produces regulatory output. End every report this skill produces — printed in chat or saved to a file — with the canonical disclaimer block from `rules/professional-disclaimer.md`, followed by one blank line and the machine-readable marker, exactly as shown:

```markdown
> **Disclaimer:** This is an AI-generated analysis for preliminary planning purposes. All findings must be verified by a licensed professional before use in design, permitting, or regulatory submissions.

<!-- architecture-studio:requires-disclaimer -->
```

The marker is a single end-of-file sentinel — it appears exactly once, as the last line of the report. The `post-write-disclaimer-check` hook parses saved `.md` reports for the marker and blocks the write if the canonical disclaimer block is missing.

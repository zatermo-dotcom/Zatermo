// under Crosscutting Concepts would take `security` and demote §12's h2 to
// security-2.

// It matches on a normalised form because the markdown is the source of truth and
// the markdown varies. A real set writes "## 1 Goals and Scope" — number folded
// into the heading, "and" spelled out — while this list and the fixture write
// "Goals & Scope". Keyed on the raw string, all 16 lookups missed and the viewer
// drew nothing, with every test still green because the fixture shared the
// mistake.
//
// The leading number is dropped rather than matched on: §3 Project Structure is
// brownfield-only, so a greenfield set renumbers every section after it, and a
// number-keyed lookup would then hand §13's explainer to §12.

## Formatting Rules

**Citation format** : `file.rs:42` or `` `code snippet` `` for inline references

**Issue severity** :
- 🔴 Critical : security vulnerability, data loss risk, broken functionality, test missing for new feature
- 🟡 Important : error handling gap, performance regression, scope creep, missing token savings assertion
- 🟢 Suggestion : naming, DRY opportunity, documentation, style

**RTK-specific checks to mention if relevant** :
- `LazyLock<Regex>` for fixed patterns reused across calls
- `anyhow::Result` + `.context("msg")` (no bare `?`, no `.unwrap()`)
- Fallback to raw command on filter failure
- Exit code propagation (`std::process::exit(code)`)
- Token savings assertion ≥60% in tests
- Real fixtures (not synthetic test data)
- No async/tokio dependencies (startup time)

**Tone** : Professional, constructive, factual. Challenge the code, not the person.
No superlatives ("great", "amazing", "perfect"). No filler ("as mentioned", "it's worth noting").

**Length** : Aim for 200–400 words. Long enough to be useful, short enough to be read.

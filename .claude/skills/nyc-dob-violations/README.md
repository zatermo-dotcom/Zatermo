## Install

```bash
# Via plugin system
claude plugin marketplace add AlpacaLabsLLC/skills-for-architects
claude plugin install as@skills-for-architects
```

## Usage

```
/as:nyc-dob-violations 120 Broadway, Manhattan
/as:nyc-dob-violations 1000770001          (BBL)
/as:nyc-dob-violations 1001389             (BIN)
```

The skill:

1. **Resolves the property** via PLUTO — gets BBL and building metadata (BIN via Building Footprints when needed)
2. **Queries three violation datasets** — DOB violations, ECB violations, and active/open violations
3. **Flags open violations** with a warning indicator at the top of the report
4. **Presents all violations** — with types, dates, dispositions, and ECB penalty amounts

## Data Sources

| Source | Dataset ID | What it provides |
|--------|-----------|-----------------|
| PLUTO | `64uk-42ks` | Address resolution, BBL/BIN |

## Output

# Tooling catalog

Architecture Studio skills install together in one flat catalog so every workflow can be invoked directly. The links below use Claude Code's `/as:<skill>` namespace; Codex invokes the same installed skills as `$<skill>`. These groups describe what the tools do; they are not separate plugins or installation packages.

## Firm operations

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`/as:studio`](./studio) | Set up and inspect the studio, route work, and create projects |
| [`/as:tool-catalog`](./tool-catalog) | Show the available skills and agents |
| [`/as:learn`](./learn) | Guided, resumable introduction to Codex and Claude Code for architects (use `$learn` on Codex) |
| [`/as:skill-maker`](./skill-maker) | Create studio-wide or project-specific procedures outside the plugin cache |
| [`/as:studio-feedback`](./studio-feedback) | Prepare a reviewed bug report or feature request without automatic submission |

## Project management

### Project Records

Project records form a linked graph of plain files. `/as:project` is the setup and memory interface: `PROJECT.md` owns sourced facts and `decisions/` owns durable reasoning. Meetings and site reports preserve source context, the canonically resolved project or studio `TASKS.md` owns action history, work plans read those records, and `TIMELOG.md` records only user-confirmed durations.

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [`/as:project`](./project) | Initialize a project, maintain sourced facts, and manage durable decisions |
| [`/as:workplan`](./workplan) | Plan repository, operational, or AEC delivery work before acting |
| [`/as:meeting-minutes`](./meeting-minutes) | Create source-linked meeting records with explicit promotion handoffs |
| [`/as:site-visit-report`](./site-visit-report) | Record field observations, reported information, limitations, and follow-up candidates |
| [`/as:tasklist`](./tasklist) | Maintain project tasks or an opted-in studio portfolio register |
| [`/as:timetracker`](./timetracker) | Reconstruct activity and append only user-confirmed time |

## Individual skill documentation

Each directory contains an authoritative `SKILL.md`, a human-facing `README.md`, and any scripts, references, templates, or data owned by that skill. Create studio or project procedures with `/as:skill-maker`; to contribute a built-in skill, read [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md).
